For this Lab, VSCode was the primary IDE, along with Node.JS, React, and Express as the main libraries. 
Git was used as the VCS, and we initialized the project as an Organization level project in Github to 
allow us to attach a Project to it, create issues for all tasks, and collaborate with better efficiency.
